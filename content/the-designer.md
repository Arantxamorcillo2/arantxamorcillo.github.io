was born in Madrid, Spain. She moved to London attracted by the creative metropolitan environment and started her studies in fashion in 2011. Since the beginning of her career she has presented a genuinely curiosity to experiment with materials, forms and silhouettes, and this has lead her to explore her creativity and reflect it in her designs. An obsessive attention to research is essential in her creative process which evolves in rich and intimate collections.

After six years in London she still kept a deeply Spanish heritage, that became an imperative influence in her projects. Aiming to recontextualize Spanish tradition by pushing the boundaries of experimentation, craftsmanship and individuality to captivate the attention of the modern woman.

During January-February 2013, she worked with Conchita Perez designer in the development of her AW 2013 collection *“The Man Who Wanted To Be Kind”*.

In 2014 she graduated in Fashion Design (BA), obtaining a **Distinction Award** by Heriot Watt University in collaboration with West London College for *“Splintered”*, a collection that explores the imperfection outside and inside the human body, transmitting a experimental and deeply intimate aesthetic.
