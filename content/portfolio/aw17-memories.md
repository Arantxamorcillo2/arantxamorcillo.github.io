In her yet most personal work, the artist bring us back a collection inspired by the revelation of a series of antique photos. These tell the story of a life, the story of her heritage and the story of her grandparents.  Diving into the black and white pictures the essence of her elders' style and personality blossomed inspiring  beautiful lines; re-memorizing the late 50's  feminine silhouettes united with the toughness of the classical man suit, as in the most pure marriage.

Volume plays the leader role on this story,  re-inventing  the classics, between the heavy wools and dedicated silks. Nostalgia comes in the form of flash-backs: endless sunsets picking wild poppies evolved into bold embroidery details covering (as scarlet fields) blouses and coats. A muted palette of butter creams, milky whites and smoky grey underscore with black and red licorice completes the set, closing a circle of remembrance and serenity.
